        <h1 class="title">Clause-Level Sentiment Analysis Using Discourse Markers</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome to  Clause-Level Sentiment Analysis Using Discourse Markers!</strong> 
            This tool performs sentiment analysis on Taglish (Tagalog-English) texts by breaking them down into smaller clauses using discourse markers. It helps detect sentiment at both the clause level and for the overall text.
        </p>
        <h2>How Does the System Work?</h2>
        <p>The system detects discourse markers (e.g., <span>and</span>, <span>but</span>, <span>because</span>, <span>although</span>) 
            within the text to segment it into logical clauses. It then analyzes the sentiment of each clause individually (positive, negative, or neutral) and determines the overall sentiment based on these results
        </p>
        <h2>How to Use the Tool?:</h2>

                </li>
                <li>
                    View the results showing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The overall sentiment of your input.</li>
                        <li>The discourse markers identified in your text.</li>
                        <li>The sentiment of each segmented clause.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> 
                For best results, use complete sentences with proper punctuation.  Clause-Level Sentiment Analysis Using Discourse Markers works particularly well with Taglish text but can also analyze pure English or Tagalog content.
